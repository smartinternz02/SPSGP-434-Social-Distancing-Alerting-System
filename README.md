Social Distancing Alerting System

Here, we create a system that uses pre-installed cameras/ recorded videos to analyze images from public areas like Shopping malls & Streets to see whether the public are adhering to safety measures by maintaining social distancing.

This project uses python combined with Deep Learning and Computer Vision to monitor social distancing. A web application is built and is hosted on the cloud which streams the video of  Social distancing Violations
